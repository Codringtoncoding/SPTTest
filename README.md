SP Technial test:

1.I have made a programme that opens the fie path webserver.log and reads and breaks it into two hashes occurances and uniqueness.
2.I then sort these two hashes into order using two methods sort_by_occurance and sort_by_uniqeness.
3.These methods use instances and orders the occurance of the pages from desccending order.
4.I used puts in each method to understand what was being output into the terminal so I could manipulate the data.
5.Set up RSPEC to run tests.

Improvements that I could make:

More Rspec tests and maybe make it into a rails app to host on localhost:3000.

TO RUN Progam:

Clone repostitory.
run bundle install
gem install rspec.

Run Ruby Lib/parser.rb
and run rspec for tests.
